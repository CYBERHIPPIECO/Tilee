# Tilee
Tile-based Exploration Game

Town you can discover, various locations that popup as you move, kind of like in Bastion. You discover landmarks, characters.
Perhaps a werewolf story - or even a tile-based narrative platform to create custom stories.

## Tile Types

- Undiscovered Tile (default state)
- Discovery Tile (state where you know there is something in the distance but can't see it yet)
- Location Tile (containing some sort of infrastructure, building, place)
- Narrative Event Tile (trigger for narrative events)
- Random Event Tile (who knows)
- Character Encounter (you meet a person, an entity, which is either hostile or not)
